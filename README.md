# chrome-bookmarks (chrome application)

ltagger is a chrome application, which allows you to:

  * do advanced search by tags/url or title
  * add custom tags for bookmarks

I started to work on this application at [Seattle Google Developer Groups Dev Fest 2013](http://www.meetup.com/seattle-gdg/events/125948972/). 

To build this application I used following Open Source libraries:

  * [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [jQuery](https://jquery.org)
  * [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
