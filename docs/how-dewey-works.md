#How Dewey Works

⟵ [Back to README](../README.md)

**Tagging:**

- Dewey treats folders in your Chrome Bookmark Manager as tags. To edit those you'll need to go to your Bookmark Manager. (Mac – Opt+Cmd+B) (Windows – Ctrl+Shift+B)
- If you’d like Dewey to ignore Chrome’s top-level folders (i.e., Bookmarks Bar, Other Bookmarks and Mobile Bookmarks) click the Settings icon in the top right corner and check the “Hide top-level folders” box.

**Search & Sort:**

There are several ways to search your bookmarks with Dewey:

- A standard search returns anything with that word in the Tag, Title or URL.
- Add `tag:` before a word to limit results that have that specific tag applied.
- Add `title:` before a word to limit results to titles that contain that word.
- Add `url:` before a word to limit results to URLs that contain that word.
- Sort your bookmarks and your search results by Date, Title, or URL
- Clicking a tag on a bookmark will run search of that tag

**Navigating**

- Use the Left/Right/Tab keyboard keys to navigate through the grid of bookmarks.
- When one of you bookmarks is highlighted, hit enter to visit the link.


**Editing**

- Clicking the Title of a bookmark opens the edit window.
- Within the edit window you can edit the Title, URL and custom tags
- You can also delete a bookmark from Chrome.
